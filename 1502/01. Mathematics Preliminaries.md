# Sets
A **set** is group of objects represented as a unit. For instance, $\{ a,b,c \}, \{1, 2, 3, ...\}, \{\}\ (\text{i.e., the empty set}, \emptyset)$ are all examples of sets. Recall that sets are unordered and do not allow duplicate elements. That is $\{ a,b,c\}=\{b,c,a\}$ and $\{1, 2, 3, 2\} = \{1, 2, 3\}$. Note that sets can be finite (including empty), or infinite. For notation we use $\in$ and $\notin$ to indicate membership status. For example, $1\in\{1,2,3\}$ and $c\notin\{a,b\}$.
