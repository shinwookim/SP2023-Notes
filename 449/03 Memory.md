# Memory

## The memory model
![](Assets/Memory%20Layout.png)
Memory is simply a continuous series of bits which can be logically divided into bytes or words. Although this is not always the case, most modern systems employ a **byte-addressable** memory. In this scheme, individual bytes can be read, and each and every byte has its own unique **address** (starting at address 0, and increasing upwards with more memory).
